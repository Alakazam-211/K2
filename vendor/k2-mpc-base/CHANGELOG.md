# Changelog

## v0.3.0 (2026-10-27)

Blame (P22 live). The API contract is `docs/SESSIONS.md` ("Blame"; amendment 8, additive,
lists every change). **Store format stays 3**: one new table, so a v0.2.0 build still reads
and writes a v0.3.0 store (N−1, K-FMT-10). No new dependency.

**What's in it**
- **`Session::blame(conn, root, lines)`** (needs history): each line's most recent author at
  the character's grain. The engine gives every live character's client and clock (Yrs
  `diff_range`, on a throwaway replica, O(doc) per call; the live doc is untouched); the store
  maps clients to pids and clocks to changes. A line goes to its character with the greatest
  change id (apply order, immune to host clock skew; time is display only), its `\n`
  included. Each line carries the change id, kind, surface, time,
  `on_behalf_of` and approval state, and `erased` when a purge reached its change. Imports
  blame as `kit:import`, outside edits as `kit:external`, unknown clients as `kit:unknown`
  (never a guess), erased participants by pseudonym; undo, redo, restore and revert as
  whoever ran them (U18a). `-L a,b` ranges.
- **`Blame::render(label)`**, a `git blame`-like listing with the host's labels, and
  **`Blame::porcelain()`**, shaped like `git blame --line-porcelain`.
- **Tier 0:** `BlobSession::blame`: the current version's setter and the pointer's history
  summarised.
- **The `blame [-L a,b]` verb** in `KIT_VERBS` (history kind), with three kit parity cases
  (the gutter vs the verb, `-L` vs the lines in view, refused without history). The
  stale-deferral control now runs on the row that flipped.
- **Store:** `change_clocks`, written in each change's transaction, erased with the doc,
  copied by `rewrite_file`.

**For packs:** mark P22 live: `ParityRow::live(P::Blame, &["blame"])`. A pack still listing it
deferred fails its parity test (`UnexpectedVerb`, `StaleDeferral`).

**Behaviour changes:** none for existing calls. Text inserted before v0.3.0 (and by a v0.2.0
build writing a v0.3.0 store) has no clock rows: it blames to its client's owner without a
change id, and ranks below recorded changes in a line. A v0.2.0 build's `rewrite_file`
refuses the new table (an error, nothing dropped).

**Verified locally (CI-size):** the full suite (285 tests, 1 ignored; new: `tests/blame.rs`
with 8, including a 48-case property test against a model of who typed each character; 3
in-crate; the parity harness at 54 kit cases over 27 live rows), clippy `-D warnings`,
rustdoc, rustfmt and the licence gate. The Markdown pack v0.2.0 passes against it (60 cases).

**Known weak spot:** the "live doc untouched" test compares the state vector and encoding,
but running `diff_range` on the live doc leaves both byte-identical too (block splits are
in-memory only), so that test can't catch a regression to the live doc; the throwaway
replica is held by code review.

**Not in this release:** blame of a version (`--version`), blame through the wire (C5), char
blame export at the native migration (K-FMT-5); the WS sync protocol and JS client.

## v0.2.0 (2026-10-27)

Erasure. The API contract is `docs/SESSIONS.md` ("Erasure"; amendment 7 lists every
change). **Store format 3** (a format-2 store opens and is upgraded; a v0.1.0 build refuses a
format-3 store). No new dependency.

**What's in it**
- **Purge** (`Session::purge`, owner only, audited as metadata only): the whole history, a
  range of changes, a range of versions, a named text (`--text`, optionally
  `and_remove`), or a participant. Live text is not changed: edit it out first, or use
  `and_remove`. One store transaction redacts the log (a snapshot re-encoded from the live
  doc replaces it; change ids, authors, lengths and times stay), versions (entries kept,
  spans cut, `VersionInfo::redacted`), revert records (a revert over them reports
  `erased`) and the sync replica; the file is written back first; every undo and redo stack
  of the doc is cleared (U19); the read-base cache is dropped.
- **Participant erasure:** a pid becomes a pseudonym in every attribution the store keeps,
  counts kept; their content is purged; their connections are removed.
- **No bytes behind:** `DocStore::rewrite_file` copies the store into a fresh file and
  renames it over the old one (redb's compaction doesn't zero freed pages: a deleted row's
  bytes stay in the file until then). `DocStore::scan_for`, `store::scan_file` and
  `scan_bytes` find a needle whole or by any 8-byte window (split secrets included).
- **Keyed, expiring hashes:** sync and own-write hashes are HMAC-SHA256 under a per-doc key
  (format 3), replaced by every purge; own-write hashes expire after 60 s
  (`Config::own_write_ttl_ms`). A format-2 plain hash is read once, then re-keyed.
- **Tier 0:** `BlobSession::purge` for one version (the current one is refused) or the whole
  history: entries kept (`BlobVersion::redacted`), unreferenced blobs removed at once, kit
  conflict copies holding purged bytes deleted (compared by keyed id), shared blobs and
  other copies reported. `BlobSession::conflict_copies` for a scan.
- **What purge doesn't reach** is returned with every purge (`NotReached`): git history,
  transcripts, search indexes, OS snapshots, synced folders, earlier backups, offline
  clients, other apps, the host's rows, freed disk blocks; plus the file when it couldn't be
  rewritten, and shared blobs or changed conflict copies. Rotate the secret.
- Yrs GC is pinned on (`gc_is_on`, with a `skip_gc` control that must fail).

**Refusal:** a `PurgeScope::Text` shorter than 8 bytes is refused (`BadEdit`, exit 2:
"purge text of at least 8 bytes, or purge by change/version/participant"); it would redact
innocent text across the whole history.

**Behaviour changes:** `FlushOutcome::hash` of a text doc is the keyed hash (still 64 hex
characters); an editor saving one of our writes older than 60 s is an outside edit; a
redacted version is never a `write --base` (`BaseExpired`); `session_exit` maps
`Store(CurrentVersion)` to 2 and `Store(PurgedVersion)` to 4.

**Verified locally (CI-size):** the full suite (274 tests; 16 new in `tests/erasure.rs`,
each byte-scan gate with a negative control that finds the secrets before the purge), plus
four mutants that each fail the gate (no file rewrite, no version redaction, no
revert-record redaction, stacks not cleared); clippy `-D warnings`, rustdoc, rustfmt and the
licence gate.

**Pending, to run on a Linux compute node:** the erasure gate at full size,
`MPC_ERASURE_SCALE=200 cargo test -p k2-mpc-base --release --test erasure` (the `tests/erasure.rs`
module docs give the `k2 compute run` line).

**Not in this release:** a `purged` event to subscribers and the `purged` frame (K-PURGE-6),
the orphaned-doc lifetime (K-PURGE-8), backups (K-PURGE-9), participant erasure on blob
docs, approvals for on-behalf blob writes; blame; the WS sync protocol and JS client.

## v0.1.0 (2026-10-27)

First release of the Multi-Player Cores (MPC) base kit. The API contract is
`docs/SESSIONS.md` (amendments 1–6 are listed in its changelog).

**What's in it**
- **Docs on K2-defined primitives.** Text is implemented; the other kinds are specified in
  `docs/PRIMITIVES.md`. The CRDT engine (Yrs 0.28) is private.
- **Sessions.**
  - Presence per connection; rights per participant through the `Host` trait.
  - Three edit paths: `edit_with`, `edit` + `if_version`, and `write_base` (three-way merge,
    no last-writer-wins).
  - Change events; a memory pool with LRU unload; rate limits.
- **Disk sync.**
  - Atomic write-back that keeps the file mode; echo suppression.
  - Outside edits merged as attributed changes, with versions around them.
  - Load reconciliation; crash-safe write-back.
- **Text tools (`run_tool`).**
  - Read verbs `cat/head/tail/wc/grep/sed -n/diff/view`; edit verbs
    `sed -i/patch/append/insert/replace/delete`, each one atomic change.
  - Dangerous `sed` commands are refused; an injection fence with a per-call nonce.
- **History.**
  - Automatic and named versions with retention; `log`, `diff`, `show`.
  - Restore as a forward change.
  - Per-person undo to the undo spec v1.4: per-hunk regions, `--partial`, `--drop`, redo.
  - `revert` of a named change, from a persisted record with an O(log R) position carry.
- **On-behalf edits and approvals; a history right; a host key-value table.**
- **Tier 0 for any file.** Keyed content-addressed blobs, presence, a lease, versions and
  restore, plus conflict copies when a desktop app ignores the lease.
- **Manager.** Listing and rights re-check; `delete_doc` / `delete_space` across every kit
  table.
- **Agent parity framework.** `PersonAction` P1–P31 (exhaustive), the `KIT_VERBS` registry,
  pack verbs (`Pack::verbs`), and the harness comparing the person path with the agent path.
- **Conformance suite** for text. Two genuine Yrs deviations are pinned:
  `text.yata_separating_case` and `text.yata_paper_a19`.
- **Hardening.**
  - Shape pre-checks on outside bytes; client-byte decoding gated behind the off-by-default
    `untrusted-wire` feature.
  - A deterministic, counted-work diff.
  - Encode paths never panic on a pending doc.

**Verified locally (CI-size):** the full test suite (unit, integration, property, the
convergence simulator at 40 seeds, the disk simulator, tier-0 large-file and crash tests,
golden tool parity against hand-written GNU expectations, 57 parity cases), plus clippy
`-D warnings`, rustdoc, and the licence gate.

**Pending, to run on a Linux compute node** (the same tag; any failure ships as v0.1.1):
- the live GNU comparison of the 407 tool cases (`scripts/gnu-parity.py`);
- the convergence sweep at ≈ 200 seeds and the disk simulator at 40+ seeds;
- a 10-minute, 32-participant soak;
- the revert-carry benchmark at R = 10^5 (≤ 20 µs p95).

**Not in this release:** erasure (purge + compaction + byte scan); blame; the WS sync protocol
and JS client; the rich-text, list, map and tree kinds.
